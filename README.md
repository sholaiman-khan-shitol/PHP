# Web-Tec
I've done some PHP here. We had three members groups. But one of our group member drops the course, so we must focus on our individual parts. I worked with the manager section, which monitors sales and can check the mails. I used Jason to store the data.
Without that, I have posted some of the class tasks that I had completed on my own.
